    <h4>Real-Time Voting</h4>
    <p>Turns out the teams werenâ€™t the only ones working on a deadline. The organizers were interested in a SMS powered voting application to pick the winner of the 'popular' prize Sunday night. Since we were flying out later that evening, that gave us a few hours to put one together.</p>
    <p>A couple PHP scripts later, and the real-time voting app powered by Nexmo, CloudMine, and PubNub was ready to go. You can <a href="https://github.com/Nexmo/Vote">fork the source on github</a>, and of course, build something even better. Or just check out the quick screen cast of it in action.</p>
